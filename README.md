# Multi-threaded HTTP File Server in C

This project is a simple multi-threaded HTTP server written in C that serves static files from a designated directory. It demonstrates basic socket programming, file I/O, and multi-threading using `pthreads`. The server can handle multiple client connections simultaneously, responding to HTTP GET requests for files in the `www` directory.
